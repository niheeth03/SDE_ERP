## Module 9:

### Submodule 1:

#### Goal : To store alumni information in order to send group emails to all alumni and accept payments from alumni.


Solution: Alumni must register in order to access our portal, and we store the data they enter on the registration form in a database.


We also gave alumni the option to update their credentials. We used the "Nodemailer module" to send group emails, and the "Twillio api" to send messages. Since integrating it with Razorpay requires a business approval certificate, we added a front of payment gateway.

We discussed this with the mentors, and they agreed.

Possible integration of razorpay or any other websites that are similar is pending; we can skip it if we prefer.





### Submodule 2:

#### Goal: Calling for applications from academics; filling out the necessary information and uploading it; processing by departments using the Dept Admission Login; and admission in accordance with laws and regulations.

Solution:In order to apply for admission, international students must first register. During this time, we keep all the pertinent data needed in our database so that our user does not have to continually type the same information.

Additionally, it displays the student's applications and status.
creating a department-specific admin side so that each department may view applications that are unique to their department.
displaying charges, laws, regulations, and other details.

The register, login, and application pages have all been finished, as have the hazy versions of the application status and the open courses page.


Pending: New features should be added to the other pages, and the user interfaces for the open courses and application status webpages should be updated. should contain the page's administrative area.




## Module 10:

### Submodule 1:

#### Goal:
the capacity to broadcast information to particular groups as needed, as well as the ability to send automated emails and SMS.


Solution: To send group emails, there is a special module called Nodemailer. To deliver SMS messages to several persons, we used the Twillio API.

Progress: Able to communicate with concerned users via emails and messaging.

Pending: Email attachments have not yet been sent.








## Module 12:

### Submodule 2:

#### Goal: The facilitators will be able to award certificates to attendees who successfully complete the seminars.

Create an automatic certificate generator so that administrators can produce certificates with simply the student, course, and instructor names.

Progress:
finished the same

DB integration and automatic email generation are still pending.


We also completed the payment part to pay the registration cost for the workshop.

Everyone has focused both on frontend and backend and tried their best to cope up with the team. Each of the team members explored and browsed various modules that can be used to make the development easier. The first phase of the project mainly emphasized on the whole team learning and adapting to the environment, and fixing upon the schemas and routing. So, it is a sure thing that the phase 2 of the project would pace up given the fact that the team is now well established.
